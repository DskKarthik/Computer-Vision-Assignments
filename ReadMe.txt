Note: For future purposes, I have made the files in such a way to keep track of all assignments
in the same project by writing organized and clean code. 

Run command "python assignment2.py" to see Assignment 2 results.

Filters are made in the file filters.py
Helper Functions are accessed from util.py

Outputs Images for questions of Assignment 2 can be found in Outputs>Assignment2
